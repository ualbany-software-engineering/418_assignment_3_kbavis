                I am currently a Senior at the University at Albany with a major
                in Computer Science and a minor in both Mathmatics and
                Informatics. Following my graduation, I plan to pursue a career
                as a Software Engineer. I am primarly interested in back-end
                development, but have also grown to enjoy aspects regarding the
                front-end too. I have a thorough understanding of multiple
                programming languages. I am proficient in Java, JavaScript,
                Python, CSS, and HTML. Some activities outside of programming
                that I enjoy include both weightlifting and cooking. In a field
                that demands large amounts of sitting around, I really look
                forward to being able to get out and get some exercise.{" "}
